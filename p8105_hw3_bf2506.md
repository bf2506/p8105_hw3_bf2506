```

### Problem 2

#### Load, tidy, and wrangle accel_data

``` r
accel_data = 
  read.csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(weekday_vs_weekend = ifelse(day == c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday")) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, day, weekday_vs_weekend, everything())
```

**Describe the accel_data** <br> There are 35 observations and 1444
variables. <br> Variables: “week”, “day_id”, “day”,
“weekday_vs_weekend”, “activity\_\*“(from”activity_1” to
“activity_1440”) <br>

#### Traditional analyses of accel_data

``` r
accel_data = 
  mutate(accel_data, total_activity = rowSums(accel_data[5:1444])) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, day, weekday_vs_weekend, total_activity, everything())
```

``` r
total_activity_table =
  select(accel_data, week, day_id, day, weekday_vs_weekend, total_activity) %>% 
  mutate(day = fct_relevel(day, c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))) %>% 
  arrange(week, day)

df = 
  select(total_activity_table, total_activity)
```

**Trend** <br> The man is more active from week 1 to week 3, and is less
active from week 4 to week 5. On average, he is more active on Friday.
Considering the two outliers data we found on Saturday in week 4 and
week 5, there may be some mistakes. But there is no obvious
monotonically increasing or decreasing trend.

#### Make a single-panel plot

``` r
plot_df = 
   pivot_longer(
    accel_data,
    activity_1:activity_1440, 
    names_to = "activity_No", 
    values_to = "activity_counts")

hour_activity_plot = 
    ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = activity_No, y = activity_counts, color = day)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", , axis.text.x = element_blank()) + 
  labs(title = " Accelerometer Activity Counts by Day", x = "Time", y = "Activity_Counts")

hour_activity_plot
```

**Describe the graph** <br> We can conclude that the man is usually
active on the Friday morning and on the Sunday evening, less active on
Wednesday.

### Problem 3

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")

library(patchwork)
library(ggridges)
```

**Describe ny_noaa** <br> This dataset contains 2595176 observations and
7 variables related to some weather data in New York, which are provided
by NOAA. The Variables are as following: <br> **id**: Weather station ID
<br> **date**: Date of observation <br> **prcp**: Precipitation (tenths
of mm) <br> **snow**: Snowfall (mm) <br> **snwd**: Snow depth (mm) <br>
**tmax**: Maximum temperature (tenths of degrees C) <br> **tmin**:
Minimum temperature (tenths of degrees C) <br> And we can find: <br>
145838 NA in prcp, 381221 NA in snow, 591786 NA in snwd, 1134358 NA in
tmax, 1134420 NA in tmin. Many stations report precipitation only, and
tmax and tmin have the most missing data. The missing data will make a
not comprehensive enough and not accurate enough analysis. For example,
lacking enough data on temperature will prevent us from analyzing the
contrast or trend of maximum and minimum temperatures across New York
from 1981 to 2010.

#### Data cleaning

``` r
ny_noaa_df =  
  ny_noaa %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(tmax = as.numeric(tmax)/10, tmin = as.double(tmin)/10)
```

``` r
ny_noaa_snowfall = 
  ny_noaa_df %>% 
  drop_na(snow)
```

**For snowfall**, 0 is the most commonly observed values. I think it is
because, generally, snow only happens in the winter, with a 25%
percentage in a year, and some places may not get snow.

#### Two-panel plot Average tmax in January and July

``` r
Avetmax_in_Jan_and_Jul = 
  ny_noaa_df %>% 
  select(id, year, month, tmax) %>% 
  filter(month %in% c(1, 7)) %>% 
  group_by(id, month, year) %>%
  summarize(avetmax = round(mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 2))

Avetmax_plot = 
  ggplot(Avetmax_in_Jan_and_Jul, aes(x = year, y = avetmax, color = id, group = id)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .6) +
  geom_line(alpha = .4) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ month) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

Avetmax_plot
```

![](p8105_hw3_bf2506_files/figure-gfm/two%20panel%20plot%20Average%20tmax%20in%20JanuaryJuly-1.png)<!-- -->
**Observation** <br> The maximum temperature in January fluctuates more
than in July and is also reasonably lower than in July. From 1981 to
2010, We could not see a significant upward or downward trend in the
maximum temperature in both Jan and Jul in New York. And there some
outliers in both Jan and Jul plot.

#### Two-panel plot TMAX vs TMIN and snowfall

``` r
tmax_tmin_plot = 
  ggplot(ny_noaa_df, aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + geom_hex() 
```

``` r
##to make r run faster, i get a new small table
snowfall_plot_df = 
  ny_noaa_df %>% 
  select(id, year, snow) %>% 
  drop_na(snow) %>% 
  filter(snow > 0 & snow < 100)

snowfall_plot = 
  ggplot(snowfall_plot_df, aes(x = snow, y = year, group = year)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(scale = .85)
```

``` r
(tmax_tmin_plot + snowfall_plot)
```
